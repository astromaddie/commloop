MPI_Spawn() example

Illustration of SPWAN capability in MPI


Litterary word analysis

Looks for word occurences or correlation in plays
listed under the directory  plays

----------------------------------------------

search_text.c

Sequential search code ( one file at a time )

Syntax

gcc search_text.c -lm -o search_text

./search_text  file_name


----------------------------------------------

manager.c   &   search_text_daemon.c


Parallel MPI SPAWN implementation of the
litterary word analysis

This implements a true  master/slave algorithm

Parallel search in all files under directory  plays

manager  spawn  one instance of  search_text_daemon
for each file under the directory  plays.  Each of
these daemons search one file to implement the
command administered by the code  manager

The code assumes a file name list in file  list_of_plays

Syntax

mpicc manager.c -lm -o manager
mpicc search_text_daemon.c -lm -o search_text_daemon

mpiexec -np 1 ./manager
